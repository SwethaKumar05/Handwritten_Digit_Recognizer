# Handwritten_Digit_Recognizer
The "Handwritten Digit Recognizer" is a deep learning project designed to classify and recognize handwritten digits from input images. The project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze pixel data and predict the numerical value represented by the handwritten digit.I used Tensorflow Keras methodology to give high accuracy model than the ML model.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW:

Objective: To develop an efficient and accurate system capable of recognizing handwritten digits from images, with applications in digitizing handwritten documents, postal mail sorting, and more.

Technology Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy.

Dataset: The model is trained and validated using the MNIST dataset, a large collection of labeled handwritten digits.
